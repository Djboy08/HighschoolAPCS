In this lab I created a method for each loop. 
Each loop I have a commented in the start, stop and increment.
I also wrote down the sample output for the loop.
for each loop as the start i declared as the variable i.
This i variable i declare as the start for each method.
The second part of the loop where I use the expression I set
i<= to the stop of the loop thats given.
The last part of the loop is what I would be incrementing by.
so if i was going up by 5s I would be i+=5, going down by 5
would be i-=5. 

For each of them I print i plus a space for the next character
