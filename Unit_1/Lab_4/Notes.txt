For tihs lab I had to produce a way to print out the 
factorial of a number. For this I created one method with a paramater
that I would pass in for the number i want to be factored.
In the method I created a variable and assigned it as the value of the number I passed through
on the loop I made the loops variable called i and assigned it to equal to the number passed in subtracted by 1
I did this subtraction because as we increment through the numbers I want to use the 
variable I set earlyer to multiply itself by i then setting the new value as the variables value.
So i did the subtraction of one so I did not have the same two numbers multiplying by each other.
so If i passed in the number 5, on the first iteration it would do 5x4 not 5x5
once the loop is done I print out the variable I set that would print of the factor of the number.
